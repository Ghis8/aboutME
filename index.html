				<h3>About Ghislain</h3>
				<p>
					After graduating from polytechnic institute, i did not found my vocation only with hardware devices, i wanted to know more about the software too, it took me time to find what i really love in life.
					so i decide to start a new journey in this field.
					i recently got my bachelor degree and i am so excited to make more projects and collaborate with my elders.
					<br/>
					As a thinkful developer i am ready to work with whoever on whatever projects, don't hesitate.
					<br>
					
				</p>
				<p>I love traveling and learn new languages as well as make new friends, i have been in several countries.
				i learned much during that time. can't wait to make another trip!</p>
